        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="me-picture.jpeg" alt="A picture of Ash Helmus" width="300">
        <p>Currently in the second semester, first year, of Graphic Design at Algonquin College. I am eager to learn and grow in my field. I have been interested in creative fields for a very long time. I have been known to be overly organized and detail-oriented. I am also an illustrator, doing a range of mediums like painting, drawing, digital art and more. I also enjoy occasionally playing music on my bass guitar.</p>
        <p>In my personal life I enjoy spending time with my large family, as well as friends. I also spend time with my three cats when I'm not working at my part-time job at Tim Hortons. Playing video games is also a hobby that I am fond of.</p>
